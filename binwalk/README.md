### Usage

Binwalk offers a wide range of features for analyzing and extracting data from binary files. Here are some common use cases:

#### Basic Usage

To perform a basic analysis of a binary file:

binwalk firmware.bin
```

This command will display information about the file, including any embedded file systems, compression formats, and signatures detected.

#### Extracting Files

You can use Binwalk to extract files embedded within a binary:

```bash
binwalk -e firmware.bin
```

This command will extract any files found within the binary and save them to a directory named "firmware.bin.extracted".

#### Signature Scanning

Binwalk can scan binary files for known file signatures:

```bash
binwalk -S firmware.bin
```

This command will search for file signatures in the binary and display any matches found.

### Options and Customization

Binwalk provides various options and customization features to tailor the analysis process according to your needs. Refer to the Binwalk documentation or use the `-h` option to view the available options and commands.
