# NMAP
## NMAP Overview
NMAP is a free and open-source network scanner used to discover hosts and services on a computer network. It operates by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

## Features
NMAP provides a wide range of features, including host discovery, port scanning, version detection, OS detection, and scripting for advanced tasks.

## Host Discovery
NMAP can determine which hosts are available on the network, using various techniques such as ICMP echo requests, TCP SYN scans, and ARP requests.
## Port Scanning
It can scan a range of ports on a target host to identify which ports are open, closed, or filtered. NMAP supports different types of scans, including TCP SYN scan, TCP connect scan, UDP scan, and more.
## Version Detection
NMAP can determine the version of services running on open ports by analyzing their responses. This information helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities.
## OS Detection
NMAP can attempt to identify the operating system of a target host based on characteristics observed during the scanning process.
## Scripting Engine
NMAP includes a powerful scripting engine (NSE) that allows users to automate and extend the functionality of NMAP. Users can write custom scripts to perform various tasks during the scanning process.
## Output Formats
NMAP supports multiple output formats, including plain text, XML, and grepable output, which allows users to analyze scan results in different ways.
## Security
While NMAP is a valuable tool for network administrators and security professionals, it can also be used maliciously for unauthorized scanning. Therefore, it's essential to use NMAP responsibly and adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations.
